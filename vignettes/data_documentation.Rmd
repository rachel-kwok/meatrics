## Package Data

There are two data-sets embedded in *meatrics*: `expert_graders` and `devices`. Both datasets emulate the expected format of the input data-frame(s) for all functions.

```{r}
# load human grader data
data("expert_graders")
expert_graders
```

```{r}
# load device data
data("devices")
devices
```

Traits should follow the naming conventions of these sample datasets as some functions may rely on these to recognize the appropriate trait. Most functions rely on pivoting the data-frame to a wide format, using `to_wide()` . Other data-processing functions include `merge_device_grader()` which outputs a merged data-frame in wide format and `merge_device_grader_long()` which outputs a merged data-frame in long format.
